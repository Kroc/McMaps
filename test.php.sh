Leisure by W. H. Davies

What is this life if, full of care, we have no time to stand and stare?â€”

No time to stand beneath the boughs, and stare as long as sheep and cows:

No time to see, when woods we pass, where squirrels hide their nuts in grass:

No time to see, in broad daylight, streams full of stars, like skies at night:

No time to turn at Beauty's glance, and watch her feet, how they can dance:

No time to wait till her mouth can enrich that smile her eyes began?

A poor life this if, full of care, we have no time to stand and stare.
